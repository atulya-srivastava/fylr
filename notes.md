 ## 1. Drizzle ORM (The "Engine") = The Person Playing with Lego
This is your db object.

Its job is to USE the Lego box you have.

You tell it: "Go find the red brick," and it runs db.query.files.findFirst(...).

You tell it: "Go add a new blue brick to the box," and it runs db.insert(files)....

It can only work with the bricks and compartments that already exist in the box. It can't create a new compartment.

## 2. Drizzle Kit (The "Mechanic") = The Person Who Builds the Box
This is the drizzle-kit tool.

Its job is to BUILD or CHANGE the Lego box itself.

You change your schema.ts file and add description: text("description").

You've just told the "mechanic" that you want a brand new compartment in your box labeled "description."

The db object (the player) can't do this. It's not its job.

## What is "The Plan"?
When you run the "mechanic" (drizzle-kit), it:

Looks at your new design (schema.ts).

Looks at the actual box (your database).

Sees there's no "description" compartment.

It then writes an instruction manual (a file ending in .sql) called a "migration."

This instruction manual is "The Plan".

The only thing written in that plan is the SQL command to change the database structure:

SQL

-- This is "The Plan"
ALTER TABLE "files" ADD COLUMN "description" TEXT;
## The Difference
Drizzle ORM (db) uses commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE to manage the data inside the tables. (Playing with the Lego bricks).

Drizzle Kit (drizzle-kit) creates a plan with commands like CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE to manage the tables themselves. (Building the box)

The "mechanic" (drizzle-kit) is what builds the structure.

And it doesn't just run once!

You run it the first time to build the database (to run CREATE TABLE...).

You run it again every time you change your schema.ts (like adding a new column). It then updates the database (running ALTER TABLE...).

So, the mechanic `(drizzle-kit)` runs whenever your structure needs to change.

The `"engine" (drizzle-orm / db object)` runs all the time (when your app is live) to manage the data inside that structure.
